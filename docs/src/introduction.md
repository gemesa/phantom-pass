# Introduction

Phantom pass is a collection of LLVM IR and machine code level obfuscation passes. The techniques are either extracted from [reversed malware samples](https://shadowshell.io/) or obtained via OSINT. The passes are primarily intended for AArch64, but some also work on other architectures. This book provides the supplementary documentation.

The source code is available [here](https://github.com/gemesa/phantom-pass).

ðŸš§ The book is still under construction. New chapters will be added and the existing ones might be modified.
