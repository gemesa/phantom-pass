# Introduction

Phantom Pass is a collection of LLVM IR level obfuscation passes. The techniques are either extracted from [reversed malware samples](https://shadowshell.io/) or obtained via OSINT. This book provides the supplementary documentation.

ðŸš§ The book is still under construction. New chapters will be added and the existing ones might be modified.
