# Introduction

Phantom Pass is a collection of LLVM IR and machine code level obfuscation passes. The techniques are either extracted from [reversed malware samples](https://shadowshell.io/) or obtained via OSINT. The passes are primarily intended for AArch64, but some also work on other architectures. This book provides the supplementary documentation.

ðŸš§ The book is still under construction. New chapters will be added and the existing ones might be modified.
